I copied the base of the website from https://www.w3schools.com/ and now I will rearrange it and then try to understand the responsive web design. That is the reason why I copied everything, I just don't get it yet, how the Media Queries work and everything. 

Thank you w3schools for all your online lessons and the turorials. Thank you.
